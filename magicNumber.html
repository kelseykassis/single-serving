    <p>This is a logo I designed for my friend Jess, who is going to be opening an online shop to
      sell the jewelry and resin art that she makes. I asked what things inspire her the most, and
      what was at the core of her brands aesthetics, and her response was clowns with cowboy hats.
      This logo would stand out for her instagram, as well as stickers or business cards to throw in
      with her packaged items.

    </figure>

    <p>This logo I created for my boyfriend's radio show. The radio show is called "Trevor Thyme's
      Time" and the triple T can be seen in an abstracted form within the mosaic of the larger T.
      The colors are true to the original TTT branding of bright purple, orange, and green.

      <img alt="My Logo" src="img/magicNumber_02.png" width="1024" height="593" decoding="async">
    </figure>

    <p>This is a logo I created for myself. Of the three types of logos we were asked to make, this
      one was the simplest and therefor the easiest to make with myself in mind. It would function
      as a portfolio or resume header, and gives a small idea of what my aesthetic choices are. If I
      had more time-- I would change the font as this font screams "fast and furious" and doesn't
      accurately represent me as an artist. Will work on this later.
