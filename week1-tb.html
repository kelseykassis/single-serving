    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p>So this first week was more skill building and preparation than anything. As my thesis is
      based around rug making, it is important for me to have practice not only with using my gun,
      but also with securing the backing of the pieces, shaving down the uneven sections, and
      deciding how they will be hung up. Over break, I had started a frame of rugs and ended up
      having a lot of smaller spaces to mess around with, so I made myself a small "tapestry" and a
      tufted wall flower to go along with my new rug. This gave me some hanging methods to play
      around with, as one piece is abnormally shaped and can't easily be hung with a dowel, and the
      other is rectangular and aids itself to dowel hanging.
    </p>

    <p>I also got to play around with shaving down my floor rug. A tufting gun does a pretty decent
      job of making most of the threads even, but it's not perfect and some sections end up being
      uneven, as well as thread that didn't get cut by the machine needing to be trimmed down. I
      don't have anything fancy, but I borrowed a beard trimmer from my boyfriend and that did the
      job pretty well. Definitely slow, but effective nonetheless.
