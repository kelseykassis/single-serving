    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hey there! Thanks for stopping by, please feel free to make yourself at home. My name is
      Kelsey Kassis, I am an interdisciplinary artist whose focuses are in the mediums of
      illustration, design, and textiles. </p>
    <p>My work's themes are heavily influenced by queer identity, identity dysmorphia, finding joy
      and silliness in the mundane, and my connection to 'craft' as its traditionally been defined
      as "women's work". </p>
    <p>Some common traits in my work are non-realistic body proportions (anti realism for the win!),
      bright pastels, prints-prints-prints, and plants/flowers. </p>

    <p class="bold-text">Pronouns: she/her</p>
