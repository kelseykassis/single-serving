    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <p>Alright I'm going to talk in the past tense because I am so late updating this, BUT!! On week
      2/3 I spent time sketching out my illustrations, reading some of the books I have on tarot,
      referencing other tarot decks, etc.
    </p>

    <p>These are some messy sketchbook scans of my notes. I made a list of all the cards I need to
      draw, made a little guide list of the imagery I see in my work the most, and then began
      sketching based off of that, as well as the traditional imagery found in tarot decks
      regardless of the maker. I want it to be in my style but I also want to be accurate.

    <p>These are some of the resources I have physically. Astro Poets is an astrology book that
      humorously goes into detail about all the astrology signs. Its very modern and catered to the
      internet age which is cool and all, but it's not a "main" resource for me.
    </p>
    <p>The Tarot, however, is a very nice little pocket sized guide that goes crazy in depth about
      each card for how small the book is. It's great because it doesn't talk about any specific
      deck, and rather just discusses the imagery, meanings, etc of each card. Way more in depth
      than any guide book that comes with a specific deck.
    </p>
    <p>And then the three tarot decks I currently own. The Cosmic Slumber deck is my personal
      favorite and focuses on dreams and the subconscious. The Rider deck is probably everyones
      first deck but it was my second one. The first deck I got was the label-less one on the right
      which I love, but isn't my favorite.
