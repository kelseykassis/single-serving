<h1>Week 2</h1>
<p>Alright I'm going to talk in the past tense because I am so late updating this, BUT!! On week 2/3 I spent time sketching out my illustrations, reading some of the books I have on tarot, referencing other tarot decks, etc.

<p>These are some messy sketchbook scans of my notes. I made a list of all the cards I need to draw, made a little guide list of the imagery I see in my work the most, and then began sketching based off of that, as well as the traditional imagery found in tarot decks regardless of the maker. I want it to be in my style but I also want to be accurate.

<p>These are some of the resources I have physically. Astro Poets is an astrology book that humorously goes into detail about all the astrology signs. Its very modern and catered to the internet age which is cool and all, but it's not a "main" resource for me.
</p>
<p>The Tarot, however, is a very nice little pocket sized guide that goes crazy in depth about each card for how small the book is. It's great because it doesn't talk about any specific deck, and rather just discusses the imagery, meanings, etc of each card. Way more in depth than any guide book that comes with a specific deck.
</p>
<p>And then the three tarot decks I currently own. The Cosmic Slumber deck is my personal favorite and focuses on dreams and the subconscious. The Rider deck is probably everyones first deck but it was my second one. The first deck I got was the label-less one on the right which I love, but isn't my favorite.
