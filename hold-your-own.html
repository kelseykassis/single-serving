    <p>One of my favorite books my senior year of high school was Hold Your Own, by Kate Tempest.
      It's a poetry compilation inspired by the story of Tiresias, a man who becomes a blind prophet
      at the hands of the gods Zeus and Hera--modernized with Tempest's own experiences sprinkled
      in. For an assigned cover recreation, I wanted to allude to something you wouldn't understand
      unless you actually read the book and something that would draw someone in, wanting to know
      more. Spoiler Alert!! The last line of the book is "he keeps his eyes in a plastic bag", so I
      chose to roll with that as the premise for my recreation. </p>

      Tempest used in my recreation. </p>
