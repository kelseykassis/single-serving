    <h1>Week 4/5</h1>
    <p>The past two weeks I've been focusing on my illustrations, as well as playing with type in
      tufting.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-image">


      <figure>
        <img alt="The Fool First Iter" src="img/week45_tb00.jpg" width="1024" height="593"
          decoding="async">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img alt="The Fool Second Iter" src="img/week45_tb01.png" width="1024" height="593"
          decoding="async">
      </figure>

    </div>

    <p>So the picture on the left was my first iteration of "the fool". Over all the illustration
      style is very me and I'm really excited about how it came out. However, I was not satisfied
      with the type treatment at the bottom and that was one of the main critiques I got during crit
      anyways. As well as a few minor compositional changes like centering the figure so she doesn't
      look off frame. I extended the bottom bar of the card so that I could use the pink cloud shape
      I did at the top for the card number.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-image">

      <figure>
        <img alt="Cloud Tufted" src="img/week45_tb02.jpeg" width="1024" height="593"
          decoding="async">
      </figure>

    </div>

    <p>This is my very sad attempt at doing text in tufting. As you can see, it didn't go all that
      well. To be fair, I was working in a very small leftover space on my frame and freehanded
      writing the letters backwards, but I also vastly underestimated the difficulty of creating
      small type in tufting. I think going forwards, I am going to try tufting around the letters
      first, and then filling in the letters with hand done punch needle. It will take much longer
      but i think the accuracy will be well worth it.
